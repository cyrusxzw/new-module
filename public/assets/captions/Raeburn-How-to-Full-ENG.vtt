00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.588
My name is Christopher Raeburn,

00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:08.818
I'm really proud to be introducing the
RÃ†BURN and Aesop Adventurer Roll Up,

00:00:08.818 --> 00:00:11.457
and today I'm going to be teaching
you exactly how to make it.

00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:15.790
So in terms of materials,
you'll be needing some fabric,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.011
and for us, we've used an
original 1960s aeronautical map.

00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:22.889
Of course, you could use
anything you might have at home.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:25.153
And we're using this
co-branded tape,

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:30.210
but actually anything 2.5 cm
wide will be absolutely fine.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.458
In terms of tools, you'll be
needing some sharp scissors,

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:36.612
you'll be needing measuring tape,

00:00:36.612 --> 00:00:38.537
some tailoring pins,

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:41.025
you'll be needing a thread,

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:43.326
and you'll also be needing some chalk.

00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:51.893
Arrange your pattern pieces to meet
edge to edge, and tape together.

00:00:53.014 --> 00:00:55.682
Attach these to your fabric using pins.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.068
Trace around them lightly using chalk or pencil.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.825
Cut out your fabric.

00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:13.986
The round markings of the centre of the
pattern will guide you with the tape placement.

00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:17.189
Mark these either on the
underside of the fabric,

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.584
or using chalk to the top side.

00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:25.765
You need to now prep the tape,

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:29.549
the main body, and the pockets
before assembling everything.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.075
Cut the tape into three pieces.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:36.970
Firstly 80 cm, then 28 cm,
and 21 cm.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.903
Once you've done this, you need to stitch
the tape pieces to the main body.

00:01:47.797 --> 00:01:51.078
The mid-length tape will be
attached to the upper edge

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:52.853
and inside of the roll up.

00:01:55.446 --> 00:01:58.047
The shortest tape will be used as the handle.

00:01:58.047 --> 00:02:01.368
We need to fold and attach it
to the centre of the main body.

00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:07.916
The longest tape will be attached
across the middle of the main body.

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:15.077
To prepare the pocket panel,
fold your pleats,

00:02:15.077 --> 00:02:17.867
ironing over them to
set the fabric in place

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.676
and secure them by sewing
along the bottom edge.

00:02:22.518 --> 00:02:26.180
Fold and stitch the main body panel
to make the top of your roll up.

00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:29.418
We do this from the inside out.

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:38.520
Next, we need to stitch the
pocket panel to the main body.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.370
We do this inside out.

00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:47.762
Now stitch the pocket pleats into place.

00:02:50.843 --> 00:02:53.568
We're so proud that with this
partnership with Aesop,

00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:55.715
it's all about pushing boundaries,

00:02:55.715 --> 00:02:59.153
and really creating an amazing
responsible product together.

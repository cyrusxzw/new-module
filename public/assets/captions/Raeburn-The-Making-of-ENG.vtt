00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:04.334
At Raeburn we're all
about responsible design. 

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:08.440
We want to use design to make
a positive difference on the planet.

00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:12.722
The Adventurer Roll Up is made
up of 80% recycled cotton.

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:16.380
We also have a limited run
of 300 RÆMADE Roll Ups

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.745
that actually use existing surplus material.

00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:25.040
We're really proud to be using
1960s aeronautical navigation maps. 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.973
So the maps that we've chosen within
our fantastic collaboration together 

00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:31.539
have been chosen for a very special reason.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.518
First, Borneo, which is unfortunately,
the site of so much deforestation.

00:00:36.518 --> 00:00:40.150
You really see the reality of
environmental change first-hand.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.716
Secondly, the Aral Sea
— this is a depleted desert,

00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:47.395
Again, a real focus for the reality of climate change.

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.033
The wonderful thing about maps of course,
is they have this incredible nostalgia,

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:53.872
they bind us all together.

00:00:53.872 --> 00:00:55.343
And with the Adventurer Roll Up,

00:00:55.343 --> 00:00:58.756
we really think we've created something
that has that spirit of adventure 

00:00:58.756 --> 00:01:03.525
 to enjoy of course, the products themselves,
and also to think about the life beyond.

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:08.039
So the way that we have designed the
Adventurer Roll Up, is very much about, first, 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.426
having these beautiful products that
you need for your everyday adventure

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:14.374
but then you can adapt —
you can add what you want

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.097
— and then it will continue
to evolve as you do.

00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:20.901
And we are so proud that
with this partnership with Aesop

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:22.901
it's all about pushing boundaries,

00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:26.701
and really creating an amazing,
responsible product together.
